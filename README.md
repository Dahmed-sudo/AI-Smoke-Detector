# 🚭 AI-Powered Smoking Detection System

This project is an intelligent surveillance system that detects smoking behavior in real-time using computer vision. It uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, **cvzone**, and **PyGame** to analyze webcam footage, identify faces and hand gestures, and trigger audio alarms when smoking is detected.

## 🔍 Features

- 💨 Real-time smoking detection using hand-to-mouth proximity.
- 👁️ Face and hand landmark detection with `cvzone`.
- 🔊 Automatic audio alarm using `pygame` and `gTTS`.
- 🕒 Incident logging with date and time in a `.txt` file.
- 🎥 Visual alerts: red border and warning message when smoking is detected.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- MediaPipe (via cvzone)
- pygame (for audio)
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
- datetime and os for logging and audio management
